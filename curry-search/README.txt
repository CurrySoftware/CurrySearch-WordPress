Description: CurrySearch is an advanced cloudbased search for Wordpress. It supports custom post types, autocomplete, relevance based results and filter.

This advanced search plugin provides following functionality:

* Search and find any post types including custom ones
* A error-tolerant query-autocompletion
* Advanced relevance based full-text search
* Filter for search results

CurrySearch tries to blend in into your theme by reusing its search form.
As the computationaly heavy work of this plugin is done on the search servers in the CurrySearch System, it is also very lightweight.

= Speedy and Relevant Search Results =

Contrary to the built-in search of WordPress CurrySearch lists better and more relevant results further up in the result list.
To achieve this, both the content and the structure of your posts are analysed and an advanced ranking formula is devised for every query.

The CurrySearch System is optimised for advanced speed and thus answers queries in a matter of milliseconds. All computationally expensive operations are executed on our search system and thus your WordPress-Site does not need any extra resources.

= Error-Tolerant Autocomplete Search Queries =

Another feature, not built into WordPress is query autocomple. Users know and appreciate that feature from mayor sites, especially when on mobile devices.

CurrySearch offers a fast and error-tolerant autocomplete.
Your content is fed into the system and it thus allows relevant results.

= Search Result Filter by Tags =

Another important feature that WordPress does not offer out-of-the-box are search result filters.
It makes finding desired documents simpler and faster. CurrySearch supports the search result filters by tags by using your taxonomies.

The user-interface integrates into your theme and is intuitive for the user.

= Custom Post Types =
You can customize which post types should be indexed and retrievable.
The activated post types can be set in the CurrySearch settings page.

= Is CurrySearch going to slow down my site? =

No. Evaluation and ranking of the search results is done on our servers. Your site mearly fetches a list of relevant post-ids per search query.

For now, you will have to manually re-index for every change of content.
Go to Settings -> CurrySearch for that.

This will be improved in future versions.

Please contact us or create an issue on the [CurrySearch GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CurrySoftware/CurrySearch-WordPress). We will be happy to help you!
