Interface to the CurrySearch System. Provides fast and reliable results with autocompletion and tag filters.

== Description ==

CurrySearch is a cloud-based on-site search system with focus on performance and relevance with support for 16 languages.
This plugin will provides following functionalities:

* A error-tolerant query-autocompletion
* Relevance based full-text searching
* Filtering searchresults by tags

It tries to blend in into your theme by reusing its search form.
As the computationaly heavy work of this plugin is done on the servers in the CurrySearch System, it is also very lightweight.

= Speedy and Relevant Search Results =

Contrary to the built-in search of WordPress CurrySearch lists more relevant results further up in the result list.
To achieve this, both the content and the structure of your posts are analysed and a ranking formula is devised for every query.

The CurrySearch System is optimised for speed and thus answers queries in a matter of milliseconds. All computationally expensive operations are executed on our system and thus your WordPress-Site does not need any extra resources.

= Error-Tolerant Autocompletion =

Another feature not built into WordPress is query-autocompletion. Users know and appreciate that feature from mayor sites, especially when on mobile devices.

CurrySearch offers a fast and error-tolerant autocompletion.
Your content is fed into the system and it thus allows relevant results.

= Filtering Search Results by Tags =

Another important feature that WordPress does not offer out-of-the-box is the filtering of search results.
It makes finding desired documents simpler and faster. CurrySearch supports the filtering of results by tags.

The user interface integrates into your theme and is intuitive for the user.

* Arabic
